All resources for Streamlining Machine Learning Pipelines: EDA to deployment
# GirlScript Pune Webinar 

# Streamline your process of building a data pipeline and modelling effectively 

Instructor: Laisha Wadhwa

Time: 23rd Aug 2020 05:00 – 06:00

Webinar: A comprehensive guide to building an end-end data science pipeline with inclusion of tools like lazy predict (https://pypi.org/project/lazypredict/) to introduce a fast yet effective way to run multiple models with few lines of code. Towards the end of the webinar I would introduce yet another tool called voila which helps to convert any jupyter notebook to an HTML webpage.

Details on Hands on sessions:

Access [Google colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) and familiarize yourself with running code in the colab environment.

Read the 'Getting started' guide and go through the introductory video.


To run the notebooks open the link during the session and then select either of the two options:
<ul>
<li> Open in Playground mode.
